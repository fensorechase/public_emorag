# public_emorag
The goal of the LiveRAG Challenge is to allow research teams across academia and industry to advance their RAG research and compare the performance of their solutions with other teams, on a fixed corpus (derived from the publicly available FineWeb) and a fixed open-source LLM, Falcon3-10B-Instruct.


# Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/fensorechase/public_emorag.git
cd generate
```

# Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

Please also create a .env file with necessary environment variables (i.e., your AI_71_API_KEY).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with default settings (novel approach)
python main.py --input queries.jsonl --hf-token YOUR_HF_TOKEN
```



## LiveRAG Challenge Configuration

This implementation follows all LiveRAG challenge requirements:

- Uses Falcon3-10B-instruct as the only LLM for generation
- No fine-tuning of the model (using it "as is")
- Optimized for the FineWeb-10BT corpus
- Focuses on both relevance and faithfulness metrics
- Designed to meet strict response time constraints
